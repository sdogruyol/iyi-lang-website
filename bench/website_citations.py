"""Every repository path the website documents cite has to resolve.

    python3 bench/website_citations.py            # check
    python3 bench/website_citations.py --list     # every citation found

The website documents are an argument made out of citations: the art
direction points at the stylesheet that carries a colour, the stack document
points at the script that generates a number, and the feasibility report points
at the compiler line that stops a browser from type checking. A path that does
not resolve is the same defect as a transcribed number. It reads as evidence,
it is checkable, and it is wrong, and the reader who checks it is exactly the
reader this project is written for.

This gate is deliberately narrow, for the reason doc_numbers.py states about
itself: a check that flags everything gets disabled, and a disabled check is
worse than none. A token is treated as a repository path only when it is
unambiguous:

  * it has a slash, its first segment is a real top-level entry of this
    repository, and its last segment carries a file extension, or
  * it is one of the repository's root documents, named without a slash.

That leaves module names like `samples/hello`, C symbols like
`wasi_snapshot_preview1.fd_write`, artifacts like `crt1-command.o` and
hostnames like `tour.gleam.run` alone, because none of them is a claim about
a file in this tree.

A citation may carry a line number (`src/raise.cr:240`) or a range
(`src/raise.cr:240-245`), and it may end in a glob (`src/compiler/iyi/*`).
Both are resolved to the thing on disk that has to exist.
