# iyi Website Fact Base

This document contains facts about iyi drawn from the repository itself. Every claim is traceable to a source file or is explicitly labeled as inference.

**Read the date on it.** This base was drawn from the 0.3.0-dev tree, and
the sections below that quote a number or a status quote that tree's. Where
a section has been brought current it says so; where it has not, the
current facts are in README.md ("What it costs, measured"), GC_DESIGN.md
(the footprint and race sections) and CHANGELOG.md, and
`python3 bench/doc_numbers.py` is the check that the numbers those three
state are the tree's. In particular: the version is `IYI_VERSION`'s, the
prelude is over eleven thousand lines since it took on a collector and a
scheduler (SPEC.md, "0.1.0", explains the ceiling's move), and the
collector is iyi's own and the default, not a design.

## 1. What iyi Is (from the repository)

### Core Definition

From README.md, lines 6-13:

> A language built for Developer & Agentic Experience, Portability, Performance, and Efficiency. (*iyi* is Turkish for "good".)
> 
> Those four are one design decision seen from four sides. A module is the unit of compilation and it is compiled against its dependencies' **declarations**, never their bodies — so a build reads less, a program carries less, a tool can read an interface without a repository, and a person waits less. Everything below is that rule and what it costs.

### Relationship to Crystal

From README.md, lines 23-30:

> iyi is its own language, and it is compatible with Crystal. Compatible in a way you can check: the same compiler builds `.cr` files, `iyi build --crystal` gives a program Crystal's standard library, and `require "kemal"` in an iyi file serves HTTP. Its own in a way you can also check: a `.iyi` file has rules Crystal does not have and refuses things Crystal accepts, and those rules are the whole of what follows. The compiler is built on Crystal's, which is recorded where it belongs — the licence and NOTICE.md.

### Version

Current development version: 0.3.0-dev (from src/IYI_VERSION)

---

## 2. How iyi Differs from Upstream Crystal

### The Core Distinction: Separate Compilation

The fundamental difference is stated in SPEC.md, Part I:

**Rule 1 (R-1):** A module is the unit of compilation. `import` forms a DAG. Compiling a module reads only its dependencies' export metadata, never their bodies.

This enables:
- Incremental rebuilds by skipping modules the user did not edit
- Type-checking against published signatures without source code
- Agentic tooling that can analyze modules without repository access

### The Artifact Format

iyi introduces the `.iyimod` artifact format, which carries:
- Declarations (export metadata) 
- Machine code (object code from a module)
- Pointer maps for garbage collection (Layouts section, format v24+)

From CHANGELOG.md (Unreleased section):

> The collector's first stage: pointer maps travel in the artifact. `.iyimod` is format v24 and carries a `Layouts` section, numbered 14: per type a module owns, its allocation size, its unrounded instance size, and the byte offsets of its pointer fields.

### The Compilation Rules

Five additional rules replace or constrain Crystal's open-class model:

**R-2:** Everything a module exports (`pub`) carries full parameter and return types. Non-exported code infers.

**R-2b:** `using` brings exported names into unqualified scope, written by the consumer (not the library).

**R-3:** No open classes. `impl Trait for Type` must live in the module defining the trait or the type (orphan rule).

**R-4:** Generic calls crossing module boundaries pass a dictionary keyed on GC shape. Within a module, monomorphisation applies.

**R-5:** Macros are derive-scoped: they see only the declaration they are attached to.

### Prelude Size

iyi's own prelude is small by design. From SPEC.md, section 0.1.0:

- iyi's prelude: 2,872 lines (measured via `wc -l src/iyi/*.iyi`). Designed to stay under 3,551 lines, which was Crystal's 0.1.0 prelude size (the historical ceiling).

From CHANGELOG.md: iyi's prelude is written in iyi itself and deliberately minimal. From README.md, lines 97-99:

> iyi's own prelude has no IO beyond `puts` and no concurrency; `--crystal` supplies Crystal's standard library, IO, `require` and the ecosystem. Neither mode supplies a package manager.

### Regex Engine

The regex implementation is entirely within iyi (not delegated to PCRE2). From CHANGELOG.md (Unreleased):

> Stop treating pcre2 as one oracle. Hand a macro the named captures it wrote. The compiler turns a regex literal into a program-level constant.

This was completed in PR #20 "feat/rx-pcre2-gaps" which closed pcre2 compatibility gaps by implementing them in iyi's own regex engine in src/compiler/iyi/rx.cr.

### Garbage Collector

**Brought current at 0.11.0.** The collector is iyi's own and the default on
Linux x86_64, Linux aarch64 and macOS (GC_DESIGN.md, "the default allocator
on POSIX is the owned collector"); Boehm is opt-in (`-Dgc_boehm`), the bump
pointer that never frees is `-Dgc_none`, and Windows and wasm32 keep their
own allocators.

What is built, each with a gate under `bench/` that proves its checks can
fail (GC_DESIGN.md, the stages, and the sections after Stage 4's):

- A size-class arena of mmap-backed 16 MB mappings, a thread-local cache per
  thread, pages handed back to the kernel by the sweep.
- Precise marking for typed objects through pointer maps the compiler embeds
  (`.iyimod` Layouts), conservative for stacks, registers and untyped
  memory.
- A parallel mark on helper threads that runs beside the program on a write
  barrier the compiler emits; a collection is two stops of tens of
  microseconds, the second bounded by a retreat.
- A sweep that runs beside the program in slices; an allocation-pressure
  trigger with a growth ratio (`IyiMark.growth`, 200 - Go's meaning).
- An object is its fields: a class carries a header word only where
  something reads its type id off the object (a virtual type, a reference
  union), decided by the program that links; the collector's bits and the
  other ids are tables at the arena's head. A 16-byte node costs 20 bytes of
  arena; Go's costs 16.

Measured against Go and Boehm on three programs (`python3 bench/gc_race.py`,
the table in GC_DESIGN.md, "The header round, built"): the wall time under
both on all three; binary trees 19 MB resident against Go's 18; the total
paused a fortieth to a tenth of Boehm's; the longest pause under Go's on
churn and binary trees and level on the live items.

## 3. Feature and Status Inventory

### What Works Today (0.3.0-dev)

From README.md metrics (measured 2026-08-17, rows 15-21):

| Feature | Measured Result |
|---------|-----------------|
| Edit one module, rebuild (30 modules, 7,207 lines) | iyi 0.13 s, Crystal 1.17 s, Go 0.16 s |
| Warm full build, hello / 6,900-line pair | 0.07 s / 0.24 s vs Go's 0.08 s / 0.09 s |
| Front end speed (hello.iyi) | 0.031 s (target: 0.050 s, MET) |
| Binary size (hello) | 36 KB, starts in 1.6 ms |
| Portability | Compiles for 9 targets, runs on 4 (x86-64 glibc, x86-64 musl, aarch64 under emulation, wasm32-wasi) |

## Structural Measurements (Machine-Independent, CI-Gated)

These nine measurements are checked by `python3 bench/doc_numbers.py` on every build. Silent drift is structurally impossible: the script fails if a quoted number diverges from the source. Measured at commit 03d013243, 2026-08-23 22:43:42 UTC:

| Measurement | Value | Source | Measured By |
|---|---|---|---|
| iyi prelude lines | 2,872 | wc -l src/iyi/*.iyi | bench/doc_numbers.py |
| samples/iyi/std lines | 777 | wc -l samples/iyi/std/*.iyi | bench/doc_numbers.py |
| compiler implementation | 91,337 | wc -l src/compiler/**/*.cr | bench/doc_numbers.py |
| sample programs | 13 | count of samples/iyi/*.iyi | bench/doc_numbers.py |
| prelude disk size | 100 KB | sum(stat().st_size) / 1024 | bench/doc_numbers.py |
| Crystal stdlib bang-methods | 51 | distinct `def name!` in Crystal source | bench/doc_numbers.py |
| generated benchmark project | 7,207 | lines from bench/incremental/generate_project.py | bench/doc_numbers.py |
| iyi spec files | 8,924 | wc -l iyi-specific spec files | bench/doc_numbers.py |
| CI type-check targets | 9 | parsed from .github/workflows/iyi.yml | bench/doc_numbers.py |

These numbers move only when the tree changes, never with machine or LLVM version.

## Machine-Dependent Measurements

Timing and binary sizes move with the platform, LLVM version, and compiler state. The README quotes ratios as the claim, not absolute seconds, because build time has noise and the minimum of N runs estimates a floor.

**Edit-loop benchmark:** `python3 bench/build_speed.py`
Machine: AMD Ryzen AI 9 465 under WSL2, LLVM 19.1.7, Go 1.25.2
Method: best of 7 runs, release compiler, one idle machine

| What changed | iyi | Crystal | Go |
|---|---|---|---|
| one module's body | 0.13 s | 1.17 s | 0.16 s |
| entry file only | 0.12 s | 1.15 s | 0.16 s |
| nothing at all | 0.12 s | 1.14 s | 0.08 s |
| tired session | 0.22 s | 1.81 s | 0.27 s |

The ratios hold constant across machine states. Read columns against each other since they measure on the same machine.

**Full build benchmark:** `python3 bench/build_speed.py`
Same machine: AMD Ryzen AI 9 465 under WSL2, LLVM 19.1.7
Method: best of runs, cold and warm cache

| Program | iyi | Go |
|---|---|---|
| hello (147 lines) | 0.07 s | 0.08 s |
| generated pair (6,912 lines) | 0.24 s | 0.09 s |

**Binary size and startup time:** `python3 bench/machine_probe.py`
Machine: macOS arm64 with LLVM 22

| Program | iyi | Crystal |
|---|---|---|
| hello binary size | 36 KB | 1,553 KB |
| hello startup time | 1.6 ms | 3.2 ms |

**Front end timing:** `python3 bench/machine_probe.py`
Machine: macOS arm64 with LLVM 22
Measurement: parse and semantic analysis only (--no-codegen)
- iyi hello: 0.031 s (target: 0.050 s, MET)

Repeat with `python3 bench/machine_probe.py <label>` across machine states to distinguish code changes from machine variance.

## Verified Drifts and Their Sources

Three drifts were found in prose claims about what the tree does. Numbers are gated by bench/doc_numbers.py, but prose claims are not.

**Drift 1: Sample count (CONFIRMED)**
README.md line 718: "Nine programs in `samples/iyi`"
README.md line 922: "thirteen programs"
Actual tree: 13 .iyi files (bench/doc_numbers.py measured().samples = 13)
Verdict: Line 718 is stale. It contradicts line 922 and the measured count.

**Drift 2: Import count (CONFIRMED)**
README.md line 727: "the five samples that import anything"
Source: bench/samples_roundtrip.sh line 29
Actual list: `SAMPLES="modules immutable collections init_order webapp derive"`
Count: six samples, not five
Verdict: README.md line 727 is off by one. The script lists six.

**Drift 3: Artifact build capability (STALE COMMENTS)**
samples/iyi/modules.iyi lines 121-122: artifact build "cannot yet produce a program"
samples/iyi/hello.iyi lines 136-137: artifact build "cannot yet produce a program"
README.md lines 383-387: demonstrates artifact build producing a working binary
Evidence: bench/samples_roundtrip.sh lines 50-65 builds each sample from artifacts (--use-iyimod) and runs the resulting binary, diffing output against source-built version
Verdict: The sample comments are stale. The script proves artifact builds produce runnable programs. These comments state the opposite of what the tree does.

### The Prose Claims Gap

bench/doc_numbers.py gates NUMBERS: line counts, sample counts, target counts. When a number drifts from the source, the script fails and blocks merge. But it does not gate PROSE CLAIMS about what the compiler does, what is implemented, or what is possible.

Two of these three drifts are in README.md itself, the very file doc_numbers.py exists to keep honest. The third is in sample files that function as documentation. All three are false claims that contradict evidence in the tree: the script, the running programs, the measured counts.

A website that hand-copies these claims inherits all three drifts. The site must either regenerate numbers from doc_numbers.py (already documented) or develop a separate gate for prose claims that compares README.md against the actual tree state (compiler capabilities, what samples do, what the gate measures).

## Primary Checkout Status

The primary checkout at /Users/jwaldrip/dev/src/github.com/jwaldrip/iyi is on branch gc/stage2-allocator with active uncommitted work (bench/arena_exercise.iyi modified). This branch is 32 commits ahead of origin/master (the current main branch). The branch carries the Stage 2 GC allocator implementation and has not yet been merged to master.

**Implemented language features:**
- Union types and nil-safety (from Crystal, unchanged)
- Flow typing
- Blocks
- Local type inference
- Traits with abstract methods
- impl blocks (R-3 orphan rule enforced)
- Generics with type parameters
- Associated types on traits
- Trait bounds and requirements (`where` clauses)
- Modules with `import` and `using`
- Selective `using` (import specific exports)
- Full signatures on exported methods (R-2)
- Error types (union members implementing Error trait)
- Error propagation operator (`!`)
- defer statements for cleanup
- case/in pattern matching

**Samples that compile and run from artifacts:**
From SPEC.md section 0.1.0, item 1:

- `modules.iyi` (imports across files)
- `immutable.iyi` (generic type with 575-line trait, associated types)
- `collections.iyi` (trait implemented by foreign types)
- `init_order.iyi` (declaration ordering)
- `webapp.iyi` (Kemal router port, requires Crystal's library)

All five rebuild from `.iyimod` artifacts with their imported modules' source deleted.

**Shards and ecosystem:**
- Requires work with `--crystal` flag
- Tested: Kemal 1.12.0 (HTTP framework)
- From CHANGELOG.md: A real shard is installed, built against and asked for two pages every build.

### What Is Designed But Not Built

**Garbage Collector Stages 3-6:**
- Stage 3: Root discovery (conservative, precise in scope)
- Stage 4: Stop-the-world synchronization
- Stage 5: Marking phase (point of no return)
- Stage 6: Sweep phase and finalizers

From GC_DESIGN.md, Owner's Decision section:

> Point of no return: Stage 5 (Marking). Once the compiler emits pointer maps and marks live objects, bdw-gc can no longer be the fallback.

**Dictionary-passing generics:**
From samples/iyi/hello.iyi lines 124-132:

> Dictionary-passing generics is unimplemented: `announce` above is monomorphised the way Crystal monomorphises it.

**Trait bounds on generic impl parameters:**
From samples/iyi/generics.iyi, "Not yet implemented" section:

> forall T : Show parses but is rejected. A bound makes the impl conditional, and a conditional impl has to be checked where the type is instantiated rather than where the impl is written.

**Specialised impls:**
From samples/iyi/generics.iyi:

> iyi has no specialised impls. Overlapping impls need a rule for which one wins, and that rule has to stay sound when the two live in modules compiled separately.

**Windows runtime support:**
From README.md, lines 298-303:

> Darwin is still "the code generator has no objection", and needs a runner this workflow does not have. Windows is worse than that and gets its own entry below: it compiles, it links, and what it prints at run time cannot be trusted.

### What Is Explicitly Unsupported

**Package management:**
From README.md, lines 97-99:

> Neither mode supplies a package manager.

**No open classes:**
From samples/iyi/hello.iyi lines 69-71:

> `impl Trait for Loud` — a blanket impl in disguise

The repo does not state whether open classes are planned or permanently rejected.

**Panics (exception handling):**
From samples/iyi/errors.iyi, "Not yet implemented" section:

> Panics (III.1.4). They are meant to be catchable only at task boundaries, and what a task boundary is belongs to Part V.5. Until then `.or_panic` raises a Crystal exception, and `defer` runs on that unwind either way.

**Floating-point support:**
The repo does not state whether Float types are implemented.

## Notes for Website Authors

**Do NOT state time estimates.** The repo and this fact base contain no timelines or delivery dates for unfinished work.

**Verify measurements.** Speed, binary size, and compatibility claims in the README are measured with specific commands documented in the bench/ directory. They are repeatable and load-bearing.

**Distinguish design from implementation.** GC_DESIGN.md and SPEC.md Part II contain design; the code and samples show what is built. The CHANGELOG.md "Unreleased" section documents what is shipping next.

**Crystal compatibility is checked.** The samples run identically to their Crystal equivalents, verified by the benches' own output comparison.
**Em-dashes in README.** Verbatim quotes from README.md preserve em-dashes as they appear in the source. When writing site copy, use commas, colons, or full stops instead of em-dashes or en-dashes.

**Numbers are gated.** The script `bench/doc_numbers.py` runs on every build and fails if quoted numbers drift from the source. It measures:
- prelude: 2,872 lines (src/iyi/*.iyi)
- samples_std: 777 lines (samples/iyi/std/*.iyi)
- compiler: 91,337 lines (src/compiler/**/*.cr)
- samples: 13 (count of samples/iyi/*.iyi)
- prelude_kb: 100 KB on disk
- bang_names: 51 distinct method names ending in ! in Crystal stdlib
- generated: 7,207 lines (benchmark project from bench/incremental/generate_project.py)
- spec_iyi: 8,924 lines
- targets: 9 (CI type-check targets from .github/workflows/iyi.yml)

A website build can consume `python3 bench/doc_numbers.py --list` to emit these numbers as structured data, making site numbers generated rather than hand-copied and eliminating silent drift.
