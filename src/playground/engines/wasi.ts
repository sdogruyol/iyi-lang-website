/**
 * The engine that runs iyi in the page, and the precise account of what that
 * sentence does and does not mean.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES. Every curated sample in `site/records/wasm/manifest.json` was
 * compiled by the iyi compiler for `wasm32-wasi` and linked by wasi-sdk on the
 * machine the record names. Those modules ship with the site. This engine
 * fetches the one the visitor selected, checks its SHA-256 against the record,
 * instantiates it against the WASI preview1 host in `wasi-preview1.ts`, calls
 * `_start`, and reports what the program wrote, the status it really exited
 * with, and the wall clock the run took in this tab. That is a real execution
 * of real compiler output, not a recording played back.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, and this is the part the interface exists to keep
 * honest: it does not compile. There is no iyi compiler in this page. So the
 * text in the editor is not the program that runs, and the moment those two
 * differ the engine says so before it runs anything, in a refusal naming the
 * `compile` capability it does not have. It never edits, ignores, or pretends
 * to have used what the visitor typed.
 *
 * WHY IT CANNOT CHECK WHAT YOU TYPE, which is a stronger statement than "not
 * yet". The compiler reports an error by raising, and `raise` on `wasm32` does
 * not unwind, so a compiler compiled to this target cannot hand a diagnostic
 * back to its caller: it can only die. The investigation is written up on
 * branch `docs/playground-feasibility` at
 * `doc/website/PLAYGROUND-FEASIBILITY.md`. That is why `diagnostics` below are
 * sourced from a recording of the real compiler rather than computed here, and
 * why the page says so in a sentence rather than in a footnote.
 *
 * WHY THAT COSTS NOTHING WHEN IT IS FIXED. Diagnostics leave this engine as
 * `diagnostic` events on the same stream as everything else, so the pane that
 * renders them is fed by the event path a checking engine would use. Wiring one
 * in replaces this file and touches nothing else, which is the property the
 * whole `playground/` directory is arranged to have.
