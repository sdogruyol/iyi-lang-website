"""The numbers the website is allowed to print, and where each one came from.

The site has no code path that renders a hand-typed figure. Every number on
every page arrives through this script, which is why it exists: two figures
were hand-copied out of README.md while the website was being designed and
both were already stale.

    python3 bench/site_facts.py            # the record, as JSON
    python3 bench/site_facts.py --check    # fail if any pattern stopped matching

There are TWO CLASSES OF NUMBER and the site is required to render them
differently, because they are not the same kind of claim.

STRUCTURAL. Line counts, target counts, sample counts. Measured from the tree,
exact, identical on every machine. These come from `doc_numbers.py`'s
`measured()`, the same function that already gates README.md in CI, so the page
and the gate cannot disagree. A structural number can be stated flatly.

RECORDED. Seconds, bytes, milliseconds. These are a machine, not a language,
and README.md is scrupulous about saying so: it names the exact box and it
publishes a tired session reading 0.22 / 1.81 / 0.27 where a good one read
0.13 / 1.17 / 0.16. So a recorded number is never emitted on its own. It is
emitted as a group carrying the machine that produced it, the command that
prints it, and every session README.md publishes, so the site can draw the
spread and lead with the ratio. The ratio is the claim. The second is a
circumstance.

README.md is the source for the recorded class because that is where this
project publishes these measurements. Parsing it means the site restates the
repository rather than remembering it. When a pattern below stops matching,
that is a failure and not a default: a sentence this was written to cover was
reworded, so the site would be quoting something nobody is maintaining. Same
rule `doc_numbers.py` already applies to itself.
